# Variable	Definition	Key
# survival	Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes
# pclass	Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
# sex	Sex
# Age	Age in years
# sibsp	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
# parch	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic
# ticket	Ticket number
# fare	Passenger fare
# cabin	Cabin number
# embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
# Variable Notes
#
# pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
# 1st = Upper
# 2nd = Middle
# 3rd = Lower
#
# age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
#
# sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancÃ©s were ignored)
#
# parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Parent = mother, father
# Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
# Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
